Toy C Compiler and Interpreter, focused on understanding basics

## Goals
Till now, I have three major goals;

1. understand **how compilers and interpreters work**, and possibly, get a glimpse of the rationale behind programming language design choices.

2. **apply TDD** on this project, to experience the power of this methodology.  

3. build a **complete C project** - regardless of its size with proper modularization. For this reason, I extended my very first idea to build C compiler to include interpreter, too.  

If possible, I may compete with those compilers out there, but, TBH, I am not planning to do so. This is clearly a toy project, focused on learning.
